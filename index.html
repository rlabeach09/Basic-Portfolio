        <img class="pic" src="assets/images/image3.jpeg" alt="Roy">

        <p>I am married to my beautiful wife, Madris, and father of a 1 year old boy, Roy LaBeach III. I live in Far
            North Dallas but grew up in Richardson before moving to Garland at age 16. I graduated from Richardson High School then attended Texas A&M University - Commerce. I currently work as Health Claims Exmainer. I am hoping to make a career change with the
            skills learned in this bootcamp.</p>
        <p>I have family spread out all over the U.S., Canada, and Jamaica. I have been to 2 different countries outside
            of the U.S. but look forward to traveling more in the near future. My father even owns a Jamaican restaurant, Reggae Wings and Tings, with 2 locations in the Dallas area.</p>
        <p>A few of my hobbies include listening to music, watching sports, growing my sock collection and trying out
            new restaurants with my family.</p>
